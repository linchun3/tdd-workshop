# Kata 1 – FizzBuzz

## Overview
FizzBuzz is "one of the most famous coding exercises for beginners" and serves as an excellent introduction to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic String Conversion
Implement a `fizzBuzz` function that accepts a number input and returns it as a string.
- Example: `1` returns `"1"`
- Example: `2` returns `"2"`

### Requirement 2: Multiples of Three
Return `"Fizz"` instead of the number for multiples of three.
- Example: `3` returns `"Fizz"`

### Requirement 3: Multiples of Five
Return `"Buzz"` instead of the number for multiples of five.
- Example: `5` returns `"Buzz"`

### Requirement 4: Multiples of Three and Five
Return `"FizzBuzz"` for numbers divisible by both three and five.
- Example: `15` returns `"FizzBuzz"`

## TDD Principles to Follow
- **Start small:** Begin with the minimal failing solution.
- **Three Rules of TDD:** Always write just sufficient code to pass the test.
- **Refactor:** Don't forget to refactor your code after each passing test.
- **Exact Assertions:** Write assertions matching the exact requirements.
